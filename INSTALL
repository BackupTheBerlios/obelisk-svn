0) on a debian system you need the folowing packages:
	asterisk apache php4-{pgsql|mysql|...} php4-cli php4-pear ...
1) install and create a databse
2) if you are using MySQL, import DB.sql
	if you are using PgSQL, run ./db/dbToPg.sh and then import db_pg.sql
3) edit db/init.sql and then import it into your database
4) copy obelisk folder where you want (/usr/share/obelisk) for example
5) edit /usr/share/obelisk/config.inc.php (link it to /etc/obelisk.conf if you 
	prefer)
6) generate your sip and iax.conf using script (not the utilisation of obelisk
	without ser is not yet tested)
7) include them after the global or general section in asterisk using #include
8) the script conf_gen-ser.cfg.php give you on stdout some lines to put in your
	ser.cfg if you use ser. This script doesn't give you a correct ser.cfg.
	This script give you also some sql query to run manualy on your server 
	in order to add some view for authentivation in the ser server. 
	It's probably better to create a new database user for ser.
9) install modules (modules/HOWTO_INSTALL)
//10) copy WebMenu.php from the sample folder where you want and 
//	define the menu ID
11) enjoy
