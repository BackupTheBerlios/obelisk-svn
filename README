This project is created in order to create an easy web and agi interface for
asterisk users. This is a system with a lot of module so you could create a 
simple interface with right managment with a very low number of lines of code.

At the present time this project is hosted @Obelisk.berlios.de.

In order to keep this project light for large installation I develop it on a 
SparcStation 20 with 2 SuperSparc (75Mhz) processor. This machine run Asterisk,
Apache2, php4, postgreSQL and all of my project.

The license of this project is the GPL but as the only developper at the 
present time I could sell an other license. If you have some problem with the 
GPL license, feel free to contact me : Arnaud Ligot <spyroux@spyroux.be> .
I hope a day other developer will help me in order to develop this software. In
this case, all the money of other license will go to the project in order to
pay hosting, buy new hardware for developper, ...
